# Star Joins with distributed Bitmap Join Index

This is the repository associated with our paper, ```Employing Random Access with a Distributed Bitmap Join Index for Star Joins in the Cloud``` by [JJ Brito](https://github.com/jaquejbrito/) and collaborators. The source code of all implementations used in our paper will be provided here as soon as the paper is accepted, as well as a detailed documentation of how to deploy them in a Hadoop system. These implementations include a distributed Bitmap Join Index as well as implementations of functions using it to solve Star Joins.

If you have questions, don't hesitate contacting us.
